          <p>
            The Rule of Thirds is used in this site with the very first picture.
            If you split the picture up with the two vertical lines and the two
            horizontal lines you can see that both of the character are on the
            vertical lines which follows that rules for the rule of thirds.

          <p>
            Google does a really good job with using white space in their site.
            The page is by no means blank and lacking of content, but though
            their use of white space you can find thing easy. The page does not
            look like it has too much stuff on the page and it looks simple and
            user friendly.

          <p>
            Amazon is a good site to look at Fittâ€™s law. This is because you are
            always going to be moving you mouse to click on things. The law
            states that the longer the distance to an item and the smaller that
            item is the longer it takes for you to get you mouse there. If you
            think about where your mouse is in relativity to the search button
            compared to where it is when you are going to your shopping cart.
            Both the distance and the size are different on the buttons.
