    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p class="targetaudience">The target audience is people of all ages looking for things that they can do in the
        city of orem whether they live in the city or they are just passing though. This may
        be as easy as somewhere to eat or maybe what is a good school for my kids to go to.
    </p>
    <h2>Persona 1</h2>
    <p class="persona1">My first persona is going to be a father that just moved to the city and is looking to get
        settled in. He is looking to use the site to possibly find a place of employment as well as looking up the
        different schools for his kids. He is mostly going to be using the site on a computer as most of the things
        that he is looking for will be easier to find as well as he has all of his info and files already on the
        computer.
    </p>
    <h2>Persona 2</h2>
    <p class="persona2">My second persona is a single person that is living in orem while going to school and looks
        up the website in hopes of finding fun activies to do as well as good places to eat. They will be using 
        a cell phone to look up the site for the majority of the things that they are doing cause they are alway on
        the move and rarely are sitting at a commputer desk.
